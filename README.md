## Final Leaderboard
![finale-leader-board](docs/final-board.png)

## Features
* Convolution feature extraction(deepspeech style)
* Seq2Seq(bidirectional GRU encoder, unidirectional GRU encoder with Bahdanau Attention)
* Augmentation with log mel spectrogram (SpecAugment)
* Beam-search
* Data preprocessing (deleted blank and special characters)
* Label Smoothing
* Multi step learning rate
* Ensemble (but not used for best model)

## Data
Naver has released approximately 100 hours of 16kHz Korean speech data. <br/>
* Download links : [data part 1](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1UOspFSTJ2w0wsENIeD6Ilcy5dd4NTsDV) / [data part 2](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Bh0vodkng3_SF7lLa82KePv6S7jzYEQV) <br/>

### Data format
* Audio data : 16bit, mono 16k sampling PCM, WAV audio
* Target script : Korean characters are converted to the index according to the 'hackathon.labels' file
  ```js
  "네 괜찮습니다." => "715 662 127 76 396 337 669 662"
  ```

## How to RUN

### Docker
```bash
$ docker build -t model:0.0 .
$ docker run -i --name model model:0.0
$ docker exec -i -t model /bin/bash
$ ./run.sh
```

### NSML
Login with nsml first, and run commands as follows:
```bash
$ ./run.sh # for local training
$ ./run_nsml.sh  # for NSML training
$ nsml submit (sessionName) (checkpoint) # for submit
```
